RELEASES
==============================================================================

06-30-2011: Versions 2.0.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Hashed the device id with MD5

-Added session beacons (init, admodelreceived, echo, closed) to smad.js.
 Ads can now send session beacons. The ads will only send session beacons
 when a few hook methods are called (adWasShown, adWasDestroyed). The SDK
 calls these methods only if model.canSendSessionBeacons is true, which
 triggers the beacons to fire.

-Added app foreground / background beacon firing to smad.js. They will only
 fire when the SDK calls adBecameActive, adBecameInactive and
 model.canSendAppFocusBeacons is true.

-Appended kvtech, kvdid, bid to ad call.


06-14-2011: Versions 2.0.12
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Reverted the init beacon change from version 2.0.8 which was causing
 invalid beacon sessions.


06-02-2011: Versions 2.0.11
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Changed SMAdBannerView to update frame before being given to delegate.

-Fixed issue with duplicate init being sent in house ad beacon sessions.


05-17-2011: Versions 2.0.10
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Hotfix for previous gen phones with previous gen iOS.


05-16-2011: Versions 2.0.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Added kvrid to ad call.

-Moved init beacon firing into SMAd. It fires immediately now.

-Added MD5 Hash of rid.

-Made the integration kit compile against the 3.0 SDK and run in 3.0
 simulator. There were a few things preventing that from running correctly.


05-04-2011: Versions 2.0.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Added kvrid to adrawdata requests.

-Hotfix for SMS feature for devices running iOS earlier than 4.0. Apps with
 our framework were crashing on startup with 3.X iOS. Solution is to weak
 link MessageUI framework. We also put in checks at runtime to check if
 the class exists before proceeding to use it.


04-25-2011: Versions 2.0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Updated the smad.js template to include screenshown / screenhidden pairs.

-Added load results beacons in error situations.


04-14-2011: Versions 2.0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Fixed the video player in V1 ad renderers. The video would stop and dismiss
 when you used any control.

-Fixed an issue with webview frames in V1 renderer.

-Added isRunning to the auto updater.


04-13-2011: Versions 2.0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Added a blackout view behind the ad takeover content when a movie is going
 to play. There's a case in pre 4.3 SDK where presenting a movie player
 view controller would disappear for a few seconds, before finally coming into
 view.

-Added new ViewController sub class to fix a bug documented here:
 [h]ttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3089692/ipad-rotation-bug-when-
 using-mpmovieplayerviewcontroller

-Fixed an NSDate leak when going out / in of an application.


04-09-2011: Versions 2.0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Took out echo beacon from SMAdActionTPB. The echo beacon for third party
 beacons is in the ad creative now.

-Exposed the private method interstitialAvailable on SMAd.

-Fixed a case where calling isInterstitialAvailable would report true even
 though an interstitial wasn't really available.


04-07-2011: Versions 2.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Fixed an issue with timing of the auto updating banner feature. If a request
 for a new banner went out, and before the request was complete someone
 touched the banner to show the takeover, display logic would behave
 unexpectedly. Now when the request finishes while the takeover is shown
 a flag is set; when the takeover is closed the banner is updated.

-Fixed an issue when a request for an interstitial finishes while a banner
 takeover is open. Previously it would tell the delegate an interstitial is
 available. Now it tells the delegate an interstitial is not available, but
 the next time a request for an interstitial is made there's already one
 available - so the delegate is notified immediately of an interstitial
 being available.

-Fixed an issue with requesting banners and interstitials at the same time.
 Previously requesting a banner while an interstitial request was still
 waiting for a response would cause incorrect display behavior.

-Added teardown call to the SMAdBannerView.dealloc method. If it wasn't torn
 down the view was still in the view hierarchy preventing it from actually
 being deallocated.

-Added a slight delay to the SMS finish process so that modal views will
 animate out correctly.

-Added a slight delay to the Email finish process so that modal views will
 animate out correctly.

-Changed email action to use modal presentation instead of view animations.

-Updated examples iPhone/iPad - moved the Say/Banner/Interstitial buttons into
 a container view so that when rotated they don't shift around.

-When an interstitial ad is displayed it doesn't pause auto updating of banner
 ads.

-Added SMAd.interstitialAvailable to the private interface.


03-31-2011 : Version 2.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Fixed issue with getting key window from [[UIApplication sharedApplication] \
 keyWindow]. Key window would be incorrect when an alert view is shown, or a
 sheet is shown. There's a new method that correctly gets you the key window
 that isn't an alert or sheet.

-Changed product "dim" codes from:
 *iphone_banner -> iphone_standard
 *ipad_banner -> ipad_standard
 *iphone_inter -> iphone_interstitial
 *ipad_inter -> ipad_interstitial
