RELEASES
==============================================================================

06-30-2011: Versions 2.0.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Hashed the device id with MD5

-Added session beacons (init, admodelreceived, echo, closed) to smad.js.
 Ads can now send session beacons. The ads will only send session beacons
 when a few hook methods are called (adWasShown, adWasDestroyed). The SDK
 calls these methods only if model.canSendSessionBeacons is true, which
 triggers the beacons to fire.

-Added app foreground / background beacon firing to smad.js. They will only
 fire when the SDK calls adBecameActive, adBecameInactive and
 model.canSendAppFocusBeacons is true.

-Appended kvtech, kvdid, bid to ad call.


06-14-2011: Versions 2.0.12
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05-04-2011: Versions 2.0.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Hotfix for SMS feature for devices running iOS earlier than 4.0. Apps with
 our framework were crashing on startup with 3.X iOS. Solution is to weak

 view.

 using-mpmovieplayerviewcontroller

 though an interstitial wasn't really available.


04-07-2011: Versions 2.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Fixed an issue with requesting banners and interstitials at the same time.
 Previously requesting a banner while an interstitial request was still
 waiting for a response would cause incorrect display behavior.

-Updated examples iPhone/iPad - moved the Say/Banner/Interstitial buttons into
 a container view so that when rotated they don't shift around.

-When an interstitial ad is displayed it doesn't pause auto updating of banner
 ads.


03-31-2011 : Version 2.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Fixed issue with getting key window from [[UIApplication sharedApplication] \
 keyWindow]. Key window would be incorrect when an alert view is shown, or a
 sheet is shown. There's a new method that correctly gets the key window that
 isn't an alert or sheet.


03-30-2011 : Version 2.0, Initial Release
